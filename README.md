ceur-make
=========

A free set of scripts to semi-automatically generate open access workshop proceedings for [CEUR-WS.org] [1], with special support for proceedings exported from [EasyChair] [2].

Key Advantages
--------------

* facilitates the generation of CEUR-WS.org workshop proceedings volumes
  * … particularly so for workshops using the EasyChair submission system
* enriches your CEUR-WS.org volume, as an extra feature over the standard template, with RDFa annotations to improve the visibility of your workshop to semantic search engines

Features
--------

* From a special table of contents file, generate
  * [a CEUR-WS.org compliant index.html file] [3] with additional RDFa annotations
  * [a CEUR-WS.org compliant copyright form] [4]
  * a LaTeX table of contents that helps you generate an all-in-one PDF version of the proceedings
  * a BibTeX database to make your proceedings citable
* Optionally generate this table of contents from [EasyChair] [2] proceedings
  
Disclaimer
----------

CEUR-WS.org may revise their [submission rules](http://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html) and their requirements for [index.html] [3] files, [copyright forms] [4], etc., at any time.  You are responsible for checking whether CEUR-WS.org have released new versions of these (concretely: if the CEURVERSION in the source of the [index.html] [3] template is the same as the one in [the source of toc2ceurindex.xsl](toc2ceurindex.xsl)).  The ceur-make developers welcome any [bug reports] [5] related to this.  If you manually edit the output generated by ceur-make, you will be doing so entirely at your own risk.  In particular, take care not to break any `CEUR...` annotations.

Use ceur-make at your own risk.  At the time of this writing, the documentation (both in this README file and in the sources) is not yet complete, but we will be working on this.

Prerequisites
-------------

* [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (any recent version should be sufficient)
* [GNU bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (any recent version should be sufficient)
* [Saxon-HE 9](http://saxon.sourceforge.net) (other XSLT 2 processors might work as well, but the Makefile currently assumes Saxon, and ceur-make has been tested with Saxon-HE 9.5)
* [Recode](http://recode.progiciels-bpi.ca/index.html) (for post-processing the index.html file)
* Optional:
  * [Perl 5](http://www.perl.org/) (for processing EasyChair proceedings; any recent version should be sufficient)
  * TeX (for generating an all-in-one proceedings file; any recent version should be sufficient; tested with [TeX Live 2012](http://www.tug.org/texlive/))
  
On a recent Linux all of these components (except maybe Saxon) should be installable via the central package manager.  On Mac OS, most components should be installable via [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) or [Fink](http://fink.thetis.ig42.org/), on Windows via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/).

ceur-make has not been tested on any other operating system than Linux so far; [reports] [5] from users of other systems are welcome.

How to use
----------

### Getting started ###

To get started, you need to copy the ceur-make scripts into the directory in which you would like to keep your proceedings.  You can do this by calling `./ceur-make-init path/to/your/directory` from the directory where you installed ceur-make.  Copy `Makefile.vars.template` to `Makefile.vars` and adapt the paths to point to your local installations of Saxon, etc.  (`ceur-make-init` doesn't do this automatically to prevent problems.)

### Export from EasyChair (optional) ###

When you use [EasyChair] [2] and instruct it to create an LNCS proceedings volume, ceur-make can automatically generate the XML table of contents from the EasyChair volume information.  Note that, for the purpose of ceur-make, LNCS just means that EasyChair will provide the proceedings for download in a ZIP file with a certain structure.  It doesn't mean that your proceedings will be published with Springer, nor that the papers have to be in the LNCS layout.

1. When creating a proceedings menu in EasyChair, use “9999” for the volume number (as this is currently hard-coded in ceur-make).
2. Download the final proceedings as a ZIP file and unzip it into a directory.
3. Copy the ceur-make scripts into that directory, so that they become siblings of the 9999PPPP per-paper directories, the README file, etc.
4. Generate toc.xml by `make toc.xml` and adapt it manually.

### Generating CEUR-WS.org proceedings ###

To get started with this, you need a `toc.xml` file ([see this example](toc.xml)), which you can either write manually, or have generated from an EasyChair archive (see above).  Additionally, you need to write `workshop.xml` ([see this example](workshop.xml)) manually.

From these files, you can generate the following building blocks of a CEUR-WS.org proceedings volume.

* [the index.html file] [3] (via `make`, or specifically `make ceur-ws/index.html`)
* [the copyright form] [4] (via `make`, or specifically `make copyright-form.txt`)
* a LaTeX table of contents to help with generating an all-in-one PDF version of the proceedings (via `make`, or specifically `make toc.tex`)
* a BibTeX database (via `make`, or specifically `make ceur-ws/temp.bib`).  This file is copied to `ceur-ws/yourworkshopYYYY.bib` (depending on what you configure in `workshop.xml`).  It may work out of the box with [BibLaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/biblatex.html) and [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) but usually requires manual revision, as ceur-make does not handle persons' names as intelligently as BibTeX, and as `bibtex` does not support Unicode names and identifiers.
* a ZIP archive for upload to CEUR-WS.org (via `make zip`)
