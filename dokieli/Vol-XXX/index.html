<pre class="CEURGUIDE"># Instructions for Table of Contents
# The table of contents normally is a plain list of papers (with titles/authors).
# The paper title should be linked to the paper URL (usually pdf).
# You may include "session" subsections e.g. to reflect the track structure of your workshop.
# Authors should be specified as comma-separated lists with full author names
# (like John Smith). Avoid glue words like 'by' and 'and'. If applicable, then lookup how
# the author is spelled out by DBLP.
# You may also provide additional material such as preface, bibtex files, complete
# proceedings as a single pdf, and similar items. The additional items should be
# clearly separated from the paper list, preferably after the table of contents.
# Please only tag original papers with the CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHOR scheme. Rather do not tag
# additional material with this scheme!
# For the time being, presentation slides should also not be tagged by CEURTITLE/CEURAUTHOR.
#</pre>
                <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<pre class="CEURGUIDE"># Prefaces, frontmatter etc. typically have no explicit authors.
# Note that the &lt;li id="..."&gt; attribute should have the same value as
# the name of the file linked to, just without the filename extension.
# This allows the table of contents entries to be linked to.

                    </ul>

<pre class="CEURGUIDE"># The session element is optional. It structures the table of contents.
# Each CEURSESSION must be followed by at least one paper using the li clause
# You can also use h3 subtitles without the CEURSESSION tag. Then, no
# restriction is imposed.
